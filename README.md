In This website, the User can create, delete and edit a card under a bucket that contains the name and a video/mp3 link. 
Users can also move a card from one bucket to another bucket. There is a separate tab called history which lists the mp3/mp4 links that we have 
played i.e. the card name, the link, and the time it was played
